Known Issues:
	-In the last assignment, sometimes the game would crash if the window was moved around. Doesn't seem to happen this time around for some reason, but it might.

Deep Learning:
	As I developed this project through the various iterations of this project, I never really stopped to play the game and make sure it was fun / felt actually good
	to play. I always focused more on whether this piece was working as intended or this feature was completed correctly and was bug-free, but never stopped to play it
	and think "This actually feels good to play." By the time I got to the end of the project and had a fully-fuctioning, polished product, I noticed that something
	felt off about the controls and "feel". It might be that the game isn't fitted for an xbox controller or keyboard, but no matter how much I tweaked controls and
	various values, something always felt off when playing it.
	
	If the core design and controls don't feel good, the game will never truly feel good. You can't program "fun" into a game. In the future, it's absolutely essential to
	me to quickly prototype a game's core functionality and make sure that actually feels good before going and adding all of this functionality and all these 
	shiny features. Because by the end of it, the game will be so bogged down by these additional features that no matter how much you tweak stuff, it will always 
	feel off.
